# Cybersecurity Focus

My primary cybersecurity focus centers on building strong fundamentals in system security, virtualization, networking, and governance. I am especially interested in how secure configurations, access control models, and risk‑based decision‑making shape the resilience of modern systems. Through this fellowship, I am developing practical experience with Linux, Windows Server, GitHub version control, and core security frameworks such as the CIA Triad and AAA. My long‑term goal is to contribute to the cybersecurity field by protecting systems, supporting teams, and strengthening organizational security posture.
