## Security Foundations: Governance & Frameworks

### CIA Triad
The CIA Triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—is the foundational model that guides all cybersecurity decisions. Confidentiality protects sensitive information from unauthorized access, integrity ensures data remains accurate and unaltered, and availability guarantees that systems and information remain accessible to authorized users when needed.

### AAA Framework
The AAA Framework—Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting—defines how users securely interact with systems. Authentication verifies identity, authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform, and accounting logs user activity for monitoring, auditing, and incident response.

### Governance in Cybersecurity Roles
Governance establishes the policies, standards, and oversight that guide how cybersecurity teams operate. It ensures that technical work aligns with organizational goals, legal requirements, and risk management strategies. Strong governance clarifies responsibilities, reduces ambiguity, and ensures consistent security practices across all teams. Without governance, even highly skilled technical professionals may apply controls inconsistently or fail to meet compliance obligations.

## Reflection

Governance is just as important as technical skill in cybersecurity because it provides structure, accountability, and consistency across an organization. Technical skills allow professionals to configure systems and respond to threats, but governance ensures those actions follow standards and support organizational goals. Without governance, even strong technical controls can be applied incorrectly or inconsistently, creating unnecessary risk. Governance also ensures compliance with laws, frameworks, and industry requirements. Today’s material aligns most closely with the GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) domain because it focuses on frameworks, oversight, and policy-driven security. Understanding both governance and technical skills makes a cybersecurity professional more effective and well‑rounded.
